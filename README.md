## Contributions
I wont currently accept pull requests with big changes/new features until I finish building out the current vision.
However, bug fixes and new rarity algorithms are more than welcome. 

## Roadmap
I've got big plans for this guy. Here they are in order:
1. Add a dropdown to the marketplace to hide/fadeout low reproduction speeds
2. Implement a "database" layer (probably using `localStorage`) for caching the kitties, ethereum price, and rarity table
3. Finish the popup functionality to allow configuration of plugin behavior
4. Develop more rarity algorithms that users can choose from. 
5. Implement a wallet observer in the popup - listens to transactions from the blockchain and presents them to you in kitty terms.
